This repository contains Python code to find arbitrages on the Steam Market.

![Cover: ranking of market arbitrages](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/rBxZxHX.png)

## Requirements

-   Install the latest version of [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
-   Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data acquisition

### Cookie

To relax the rate limits enforced by Steam API, fill-in your cookie information in a file called `personal_info.json`:

1. To do so, make sure you are connected to your Steam account on a Steam Community page, e.g. [Steam Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/).<br/> 
  ![steam community](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/K0P9Uxu.png)

2. Press `<Shift-F9>` in your web browser to access the storage section of the developer tools.<br/>
  ![storage section](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/xGfyU7r.png)
    
3. Use the filtering option (in the top right of the storage section) to find the cookie value for `steamLoginSecure`.<br/>
  ![filter for steamLoginSecure](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/YhlPlUy.png)    
    
4. Copy-paste this cookie value into a new file called `personal_info.json`, which will be read by [`personal_info.py`](personal_info.py).<br/>
    ```json
    {
      "steamLoginSecure": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE"
    }  
    ```

> **NB**: In the future, if you notice that the program bugs out due to seemingly very strict rate limits, then it may
be a sign that the cookie value tied to your session has changed.
In this case, try to fill-in your cookie information with its new value.

> **NBÂ²**: If you want to automate the creation and sale of booster packs, you may need:
> 1. to have a [mobile authenticator app](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator) running in the background and auto-confirming market transactions,
> 2. to fill-in more cookie information.
I have been using the following entries, but you might not need to use all of them. Except for `steamLoginSecure` and `sessionid`, the values of the other entries are set in stone and do not need to be updated afterwards.
```json
{
  "browserid": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE",
  "sessionid": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE",
  "steamCountry": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE",
  "steamLoginSecure": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE",
  "steamMachineAuth_PASTE_YOUR_STEAM_ID_HERE": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE",
  "steamRememberLogin": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE",
  "timezoneOffset": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE",
  "webTradeEligibility": "PASTE_YOUR_COOKIE_VALUE_HERE"
}
```

### Gem cost for crafting Booster Packs

To have access to the gem cost for crafting Booster Packs, you will need to manually copy information available [here](https://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/boostercreator/).

There are two solutions:
-   solution A is my original solution, but it requires a browser extension called *Augmented Steam*,
-   solution B is a more recent solution, and does not require any third-party browser extension.

#### Solution A
 
1. Install the browser extension called [*Augmented Steam*](https://es.isthereanydeal.com/), so that the number of gems required to craft a Booster Pack appears in the drop-down menu:<br/>
![browser extension](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/0eovMPR.png)    

2. Then, right-click the drop-down menu and "inspect" the corresponding HTML code in your browser:<br/>
![drop-down menu](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/jU6iI8n.png)

3. Copy the following line and paste it to `data/booster_game_creator.txt`:<br/>
![inspection](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/y1QSzS7.png)

4. Add line-breaks, so that the file is formatted in the following way:<br/>
![formatting](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/YAtWJ5O.png)

   For instance, with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), press `<Ctrl-H>` and run:<br/>
![Visual Studio Code: replace](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/aPKEI7W.png)

#### Solution B

Alternatively, if you wish not to install any browser extension:

1. Press `<Ctrl-U>` to display the HTML code of [the Booser Creation webpage](https://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/boostercreator/). 

2. At the end of the HTML code, find and copy the line below `CBoosterCreatorPage.Init`:<br/>
![javascript list of games](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki/img/JBxJue8.png)
    
3. Paste the line to `data/booster_game_creator_from_javascript.txt`.

## Usage

-   To parse all the options to craft 'Booster Packs', for the games you own, run:

```bash
python parsing_utils.py
```

-   To retrieve all the listings of 'Booster Packs' on the Steam Market, along with the sell price and volume, run:

```bash
python market_search.py
```

-   To retrieve the price which sellers ask for a ['Sack of Gems'](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/753-Sack%20of%20Gems), run:

```bash
python sack_of_gems.py
```

-   To retrieve i) the "item name id" of a listing, and ii) whether a *crafted* item would really be marketable, run:

```bash
python market_listing.py
```

-   To match listing hashes with badge creation details, run:

```bash
python market_utils.py
```


-   To retrieve the ask and bid for 'Booster Packs', run:

```bash
python market_order.py
```

-   To find market arbitrages, e.g. sell a pack for more (fee excluded) than the cost to craft it (fee included), run:

```bash
python market_arbitrage.py
```

-   To look for games which i) are likely to have high bid orders for their booster packs, and ii) which I may not own yet, run:

```bash
python market_buzz_detector.py
```

-   To look for **free** games which i) feature trading cards (and thus crafting of booster packs), and ii) which I do not own, run:

```bash
python free_games_with_trading_cards.py
```

## Results

The [Wiki](https://github.com/woctezuma/steam-market/wiki) shows a ranking of packs with high buy orders.
